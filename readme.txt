This plugin enables you to record and insert screencasts to blog posts, directly from within the WordPress backend.

== Description ==

The plugin adds a button to the TinyMCE editor which can be used to start a Java based screen recorder.
You can use this screen recorder to record your PC screen, including sound, in unlimited high resolutions and not limited video lengths.
When you click on the screen recorder's save button, the new screencast gets uploaded into the Skoffer.com computer cloud and automatically inserted into your blog post.
This makes screencasting easier than including images to a blog post. You don't need to register anywhere to use this plugin. 
Just install it and you are able to record screencasts with resolution of 1600x1200 pixels or higher in seconds.


== Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file you downloaded to a location on your local machine
2. Upload the `skoffer-screencast-recorder` folder and all contents into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it, you will find a new button inside the TinyMCE editor. Just click this button to start recording a screencast.
